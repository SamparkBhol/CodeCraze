# ðŸ“˜ Usage Tutorials

This guide will walk you through using **My Custom Programming Language** and its IDE.

## Writing Your First Script

1. Open the IDE.
2. In the playground, type:

    ```my-lang
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```

3. Click **Run** to execute.

## Working with Functions

1. Define a function in the playground:

    ```my-lang
    def greet(name):
        return "Hello, " + name
    ```

2. Call the function:

    ```my-lang
    greet("Alice")
    ```

3. Observe the output.

## Using Natural Language Commands

In the playground, try typing a natural language command like:

```plain
Create a variable named count and set it to 5.
```

The IDE will convert this command into code:

```my-lang
count = 5
```

## Debugging

Use the built-in debugger by adding breakpoints and inspecting variables:

```my-lang
x = 10
y = 20
breakpoint()
z = x + y
```
